# Intensive

The Home page of my website is explaining what it can achieve and our goal.

to create a note you will need to go to the navigation and click on the create note, once clicked you will be directed to a new page.

on the debt form on the very bottom it is going to have a name already filled out.

on the top underneath Who owes you money put the name of person that owes you money and the bottom will change to that person, same goes with description and with amount owed
